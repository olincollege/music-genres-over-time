## How to Obtain Data
To obtain data, first install the wikipedia package and discogs client. The [wikipedia package](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/) is used to get articles from Wikipedia. To install it, use the following command: `$ pip install wikipedia`. The [discogs client](https://github.com/discogs/discogs_client) is used to access Discog's API Python. We used it to query the Discogs database for information on the genre of songs. To install it, use the following command: `$ pip install discogs_client`.
